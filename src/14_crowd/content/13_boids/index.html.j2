A boid is defined by its
* - Position
* - Speed
* - Forces acting on it


<br>

Three basic local __steering behaviors__ to model flocks

* - **Cohesion** between local particles
* - **Alignment** between local particles
* - **Separation** between too close particles


<br>

* => Leads to emerging global behaviors.
