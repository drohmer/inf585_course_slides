* Q. What is the equation of motion ?
** (taking into account the bouncing)
** \(p(t)=...\)

<br>


div::[font-size:80%;]
** Help:
** - __Consider a particle emited at time \(t=0\)__
** - __At what time \(t_i\), the particle touches the ground ?__
** - __What is the new speed after impact ?__
** - __Express the complete equation of trajectory (piecewise definition)__

* Bonus: How the "impact shadow" effect is computed ?
